# Password Generator

I was tasked with creating a random password generator using javascript. 

## Description

The password needed to be completely random given certain criteria the user provides. This includes the length of the password and whether it should contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or special characters. 

After the user inputs a character length they are asked if they would like the random password to have each of the above criteria. Once they confirm each of the options a random password is generated.
